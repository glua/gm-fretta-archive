# Garry's Mod Fretta Gamemode Archive
This repository is a collection of old Fretta gamemodes for Garry's Mod. Fretta is a gamemode framework which includes several built-in common features such as a round system and end-game voting. The gamemodes were originally built for GMod 12 which means that many them are unlikely to work out of the box. The Fretta base gamemode is available at [JetBoom/fretta13](https://github.com/JetBoom/fretta13).

The following gamemodes are included in the repository:
